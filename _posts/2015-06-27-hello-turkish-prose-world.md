## Its a TURKISH WORLD

This is an example of a new post using Prose.io. Using their friendly UI I was able to easily create a new post. I can also easily insert images by draggind and droppin them on the screen, like the ones you see below:

![7525916300_5523c2ce9d_b.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/7525916300_5523c2ce9d_b.jpg)

When you drag-and-drop an image on the screen it automagically uploads the file to your "Media" directory and then includes a properly formatted link in the post to ensure that it renders correctly.
