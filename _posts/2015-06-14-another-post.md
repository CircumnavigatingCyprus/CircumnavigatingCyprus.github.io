Here is another post. As you can see, there are two markers that appear on the map

More of the same only this time, there is a picture of hummus to enjoy!

##Hummus
![This hummus is from Israel not Cyprus](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vAN0uXNtnDESrwn4aobVzAAKi9VpWX5sd2y1Uw5RhA=w1620-h911-no "Again not in Cyprus")

Israeli Hummus, as opposed to Cypriot Hummus. I don't have any pictures from Cyprus :(.
