## Talking with Günay

As we began our walk from Famagusta up to the Karpaz peninsula we stopped at a local market to purchase water and snacks for the long trek ahead. There we met storeowner Günay Can, a Turkish Cypriot originally from a small village near Laranca. While we only chatted briefly, Günay simply and eloquently explained some of the challenges that must be overcome before unification can be reached. 

"They must trust each other." He said, referring to Greek and Turkish Cypriots. "Otherwise, it's difficult."

Günay often visits his childhood home in south Cyprus, and he has no problem crossing the border. Still, he says some people are scared of reunification, and he thinks more time is the answer.

“People must feel safe.” He said. “Safety is the most important thing.”
