## Glamour shots Cyprus' coastline

We began the last stretch of our journey by trekking through Akamas, the promontory and cape at the northwest extremity of Cyprus. This area is a national park and considered to be Cyprusâ€™ best-preserved natural area with unique biodiversity. While there were few locals for us to talk to, we did get to experience some of the most beautiful landscapes in Cyprus. Check them out for yourself:

The goats were the only locals we encountered. These fellas were particularly friendly.

A trailmarker is used as target practice. This was a common sight throughout all of southern Cyprus.

Downhill and towards the sea, our favorite direction.

As weather began to heat up, we made sure to take shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. This was our favorite rest spot.

After hiking for 14 miles, we were so excited to have a homemade meal!

On our last night of camping we used an old military pillbox as a windbreak...
