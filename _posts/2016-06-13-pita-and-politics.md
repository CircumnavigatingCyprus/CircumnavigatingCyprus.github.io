## Is a Solution Possible?

As we walked south from Paphos, we stopped for a lunch break in Yersokipou. We settled at a traditional Cypriot lunch spot for a mixed pita(my favorite) and a salad.

They had amazing sheftalia and the owner, George, was happy to share the recipe with us. FYI, the secret is in the onions. 

After a while the subject changed form the food of Cyprus, to the island itself. 

George does not believe there can be a solution to the island’s segregation because “Turkey does not give back land when they conquer it”

George does have many Turkish Cypriot friends from North Cyprus and he is very fond of them. “Nothing separates us. They are not Turkish and we are not Greek; we are Cypriots. The only difference is religion and it does not matter. We think the same. We are the same.”

I asked George what would need to happen for the island to be peacefully unified and he replied, “I don’t believe we need a special agreement for a solution. The Turks have to go away and we will be fine. 

George’s wife Chrystalleni moved to Yeroskipou from lower Dyrenia when she was three years old. When they fled to southern Cyprus, she and her family lived in tents and then bungalows until her father got a job at the port. They were refugees as their home was in the militarized zone. They still cannot go to it. She is hopeful for a solution, but knows it will not be easy.  

They also sent us off with from apricots and plums for the road. Thanks Guys!
