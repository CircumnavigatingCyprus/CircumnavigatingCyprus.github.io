        <title>Stella’s Story</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-first-hand-account&quot;&gt;A First-Hand Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_2001_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_2001_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Larnaca we stayed one night with Nicolas and his mother Stella. Before the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus, Stella and her family had moved to the U.K. because her husband had found work there. But in 1974 Stella had returned to her village of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dipkarpaz+936140/@35.6081466,34.3069812,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14df676bb777dc15:0x2838425b34dd7122!8m2!3d35.6176824!4d34.4087307&quot;&gt;Rizokarpaso&lt;/a&gt;(in the north) with her four children because her mother had passed away; her husband had stayed behind to work in England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Greek Cypriots of Rizocarpaso had learned that Turkish troops had entered the island and cut off the north from the south, they knew they could not escape to the south so they hid in the forest. Stella described the night as:
“Terrifying…It was the most fearful night of my life. We did not sleep that night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_2028_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_2028_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neighboring village of Galinoporni, populated by Turkish Cypriots were good friends of the Rizokarpaso residents. Stella said they were extremely close, like “brothers and sisters”. Her friends in Galinoporni spoke to the Turkish troops explained their relationship, asking the troops to leave the village alone. Stella credits her friend’s actions for their safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, She would like to see Cyprus unified and she believes the Turkish Cypriot friends she remembers would want the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We all want Cyprus to be unified so we can all go back to our homes and our land. Our families were farmers. We lived off this land and we want to go back to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Landing in Larnaca</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;salty-shores-and-hallowed-grounds&quot;&gt;Salty Shores and Hallowed Grounds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With thunderstorms in the afternoon forecast once again, we started our ten-mile hike to Larnaca bright and early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1792_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1792_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop when we arrived in the city was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_Salt_Lake&quot;&gt;Larnaca Salt Lake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1799_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1799_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the lake’s west bank stands a mosque that was impossible to miss so we made our way there to find the &lt;em&gt;Hala Sultan Tekke&lt;/em&gt; also known as the Mosque of Umm Haram, one of the holiest of shrines within Ottoman Islam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1820_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1820_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm Haram was the wet nurse of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and it is believed she passed away and was entombed here in the seventh century A.D. during the first Arab raids on Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1881_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1881_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1883_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1883_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These grounds, composed of the mosque, mausoleum, minaret, cemetery and living quarters have been preserved and are still being used for worship today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1846_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1846_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the southern side of the island is predominantly Orthodox Christian, this holy sight is preserved and functions today as a mosque. It stands as a reminder of the islands history and short-lived unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1832_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1832_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the rest of our day, we’re just trying to stay dry…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1939_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1939_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and enjoying a Frappé in Larnaca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_8918_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_8918_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don’t Rain on my….Expedition</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-met-george&quot;&gt;How we met George&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day started as usual, but the weather later dictated our course and led us to meet some incredible Cypriots…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_0715_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_0715_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left our campsite this morning in the port town of Zygi and headed east, not knowing exactly how far we would make it with dark clouds on the horizon and rain in the forecast. We made it 8km before tucking into a café for lunch and to wait out the storm, which had just begun. We met some locals, ate sandwiches, drank Cypriot coffee, played backgammon, and Anna &amp;amp; Vasili may or may not have fallen asleep sitting upright on the couch in the café.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1477_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1477_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1495_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1495_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when we thought the storm had passed, we geared up and continued walking east toward Larnaca. We made it 15 paces before the sky opened up and started dumping on us. Fortunately, George, a man we met at the café lives across the street and urgently ushered us into his dry, warm home. We were also fortunate to meet his wife Chris who prepared fresh &lt;a href=&quot;http://kopiaste.org/2007/11/bourekia-me-freskia-anari-pastries-with-fresh-anari-cheese/&quot;&gt;bourekia&lt;/a&gt; and stocked us up with oranges and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paximadia&quot;&gt;paximadia&lt;/a&gt; for the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1499_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1499_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young man, George fought in the Cypriot military during the conflict leading up to the Turkish occupation. He was shot twice in those days but did not share the story of how it happened. Even still, he feels an affinity for Turkish-Cypriots.
As a child, George went to school and played along side Turkish Cypriots, all of them speaking both Greek and Turkish while interacting. He believes today’s Turkish-Cypriot are the same people he shares these memories with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1527_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1527_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_1531_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_1531_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, George would like to see Cyprus as a unified independent nation but fears that it will not happen due to the island’s strategic location. He thinks the United States, United Kingdom and Turkey have a shared interest in the island because it is a stepping-stone to the Middle East, Africa and Europe, and keeping the island segregated makes it easier to control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/thumb_IMG_2019_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thumb_IMG_2019_1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you George and Chris for keeping us out of the rain, for the amazing bourekia, and for the insight on your island.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A treasure found on the trail </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we walked from Zygi to Matazos, two small fishing villages in the Larnaca District of Cyprus. Along the way we visited an archaeological site in Maroni, but we found more than ancient ruins there. Next stop, Kiti.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A bit about Cyprus</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-and-overly-simplified-history-of-the-cyprus-conflict&quot;&gt;A brief and overly-simplified history of the Cyprus conflict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Cyprus’ central location in the Mediterranean, EU membership, and exceeding beauty, this island is fairly unknown outside of Europe. Often people assume that a discussion of Cyprus is either about a) a tree, b) a Southern California city named after a tree, c) money laundering, or d) an obscure legal doctrine.  In reality, Cyprus is a divided island in the heart of the Eastern Mediterranean that brought you Cat Stephens, George Michael, and haloumi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1960 to 1974, Cyprus was briefly an independent country after over 70 years of British rule.  The island was divided in 1974 when, after 14 years of independence with uneasy relations between the island’s ethnic Turkish community and ethnic Greek community, the military dictatorship in Greece stage a coupe to take the island.  Turkey intervened on behalf of the ethnic Turkish minority and occupied approximately 37 percent of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/IMG_ori.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_ori.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matter stands at a stalemate with the island divided- Greek Cypriots in the southern portion of the island and Turkish Cypriots in the north.  Prior to 1974, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots were mixed evenly across the island. Today there are few Greek Cypriots in the North and few Turkish Cypriots in the South.  There have been many attempts to unify the island, some with glimmers of hope, but ultimately the barbed wire that divides the island has held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.fath3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13116047_1157624697602684_6687651883232887284_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;border&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For roughly a decade, crossing the border that divides North from South has been possible.  This expedition will examine the attitudes of the communities on both sides of that border.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Expedition Prep: Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;visiting-the-antoniou-plantation&quot;&gt;Visiting the Antoniou Plantation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, expedition team member, Vasili, and expedition website designer, Ori, arrived in Cyprus.  To introduce these first-timers to this beautiful island, we visited my uncle Takis’ farm, &lt;a href=&quot;http://antoniouplantations.com/&quot;&gt;The Antoniou Plantation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uncle welcomed us to the island by giving us a tour of the farm, and teaching us about some of the local agriculture. He taught us how to eat pods from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratonia_siliqua&quot;&gt;carob&lt;/a&gt; tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/tzhmhwbybko32aa/IMG_1448.jpg?dl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Uncle Takis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carob tree is common throughout the eastern Mediterranean, and the pod can be ground into a powder, turned into a chip, or made into syrup to be used as a substitute for chocolate. In Cyprus, carob syrup is known as “Cyprus’s black gold” and is widely exported. But we prefer it straight from the tree!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljonx20hxi9nf7a/Ori.jpg?dl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Ori eats a carob pod&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of days, we’ll be prepping for the walk and exploring the Easter (Πάσχα) festivities in Parekklisia. We look forward to showing you more of our family’s village and beyond!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How it started...</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-origin-story-of-the-expedition&quot;&gt;The Origin Story of the Expedition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all good ideas, this expedition was born from good food, great company, and lots of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a blisteringly hot evening in the summer of 2014. I sat at a taverna in Parekklisia, Cyprus, surrounded by aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings. It was here that my brother, my cousin, and I decided we would walk the entire island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in California, my brother and I became accustomed to long haul drives spanning the entire state.  So when visiting Cyprus, we are often struck by the size of the island. And during this particular trip to visit family, we noticed that our cousins viewed the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus differently from our aunts and uncles. We decided that walking the island, and talking to young Cypriots along the way, would help us understand the true meaning of Cypriot identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two years later, after applying for and receiving the National Geographic Society Young Explorers grant, raising over $6,000 through a crowdfunding campaign, and adding Vasili to our team, we are finally ready to start walking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for images, videos, and stories of the Cypriot identity – Greek, Turkish and everything in between!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Team Member Spotlight: Vasili</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;meet-vasili-sotiropulos&quot;&gt;Meet Vasili Sotiropulos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m Vasili. My life has changed quite a bit over the past year. I decided last fall to trade in my 9-to-5 office-life of spreadsheets and fluorescent lighting for a year of adventure. I quit my job, moved out of my home and haven’t looked back since. So far I’ve sailed Mexico’s Pacific Coast and the Caribbean Sea, snow shoed in Oregon, road tripped from Long Beach to Montana, hiked glaciers in Alaska and surfed the Southern California Coast.  But I couldn’t be more excited for what’s next…our journey around Cyprus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expedition gives me the opportunity combine my love for the outdoors with a firsthand look at the sociopolitical landscape of this Mediterranean Island. I’m most excited for the unknown. Who will we meet? What will we learn? What problems will we solve? What will we find?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team we have put together is incredible and we all have roots in the Mediterranean. We have an eclectic set of skills and knowledge that will lend themselves nicely to our voyage. Beyond that, I consider this team family, and I can’t wait to take the first step with them.&lt;/p&gt;
