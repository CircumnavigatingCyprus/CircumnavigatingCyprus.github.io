<h2 id="its-a-prose-world">Its a PROSE WORLD</h2>

<p>This is an example of a new post using Prose.io. Using their friendly UI I was able to easily create a new post. I can also easily insert images by draggind and droppin them on the screen, like the ones you see below:</p>

<p><img src="/anna-site/_posts/7525916300_5523c2ce9d_b.jpg" alt="7525916300_5523c2ce9d_b.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/anna-site/_posts/IMG_7255.JPG" alt="IMG_7255.JPG" /></p>

<p>When you drag-and-drop an image on the screen it automagically uploads the file to your “Media” directory and then includes a properly formatted link in the post to ensure that it renders correctly.</p>
