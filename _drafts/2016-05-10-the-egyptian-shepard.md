## Cypriot identity without Cypriot blood

![IMG_1341.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/IMG_1341.jpg)

This is Najib, a shepherd from Egypt. We met Najib while passing through the village of Agios Theodoros on May 5th.  Najib came to Cyprus on a work visa four months ago to escape the political unrest occurring in Egypt. As an Egyptian, Najib can only hold a work visa in Cyprus for six months.  Although he is not from Cyprus and will soon have to leave, Najib spoke very highly of Cyprus.

As we travel, we are beginning to realize that this island is inhabited and loved by more than just Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the Cypriot identity is embodied by people of many different ethnicities.
