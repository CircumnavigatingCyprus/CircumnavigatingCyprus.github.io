Whether you are in North or South Cyprus, the food is good, fresh, and plentiful.

Fresh Artichokes...

We were hoping to circumnavigate Cyprus and drop a few kilos in the process, but that might not go according to plan. Sheftalia, Kebab, Mix Pita, Donnor, Durum, Meze, and the list goes on and on. We have thoroughly
enjoyed hiking, and eating, our way through Cyprus.

If you order meze be prepared for a lot of food. Similar to Spanish tapas, you will get a variety of small plates with olives, hummus, beats, salad, tahini, mushrooms, fish roe dip, tzatziki, yogurt, capers, etc. Then the main course arrives….

Even the simple meals are good. Halloumi is sold at most gas stations which goes with everything so far. Our favorite camp meal so far is canned sardines, halloumi cheese, fresh bread and dried fruits & nutts. Lemon, of course, garnish almost everything and luckily there are enough lemon trees on this island to fee the Russian army(Don’t get any ideas Putin). SO you never have to look to far to find a fresh squeeze.
